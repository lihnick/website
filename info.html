			<h2>I love Blender</h2>
			<p>Started as a hobby in high school before discovering my field in college.</p>
			<p>Blender is my creative outlet to design anything with no limitation on ideas.</p>
			<p>Occasionally helped me visualize and/or verify homework in multivariable calculus (calc 3), linear algebra, and computer graphics.</p>
			<p>Executing these ideas would not be possible without Computer Science, which led to virtual reality</p>

			<h2>Virtual Reality is awesome</h2>
			<p>My experience with virtual reality is mainly on the web, started in WildHacks 2016 as a game called <a href="https://devpost.com/software/spacehacks">spacehacks</a> in which two players work as a team to solve challenges.</p>
			<p>The potential of virtual reality has led to <a href="https://github.com/illinoistechesi/davyjoneslocker">Davy Jones' Locker</a>, a project to visualize and motivate learning.</p>

			<h2>Prototyping on the Web</h2>
			<p>Web follows a constructivism approach to develop applications that run on numerous platforms.</p>
			<p>Prototypes can be quickly built and tested using platforms such as <a href="https://firebase.google.com/">firebase</a> and <a href="https://www.github.com/">github pages</a>, allowing more time spent on improving the idea, and less time coding.</p>
